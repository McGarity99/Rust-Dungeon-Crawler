# Rust-Dungeon-Crawler
Repo for dungeoncrawler game built in preparation for CSCI 7200
<br />
This repo is inteded to hold the source code and resources for the dungeoncrawler game made in Rust with the bracket-lib crate and the Legion ECS system. It is primarily for demonstrational purposes to show where my work in CSCI 7200 began, as I plan on expanding on this game over the Summer of 2022.
<br />
The game was developed through the book "Hands-on Rust", by Herbert Wolverson (ISBN 978-1-68050-816-1). Through this book/exercise, I learned of several important aspects of game design, such as Entity Component Systems and data-driven design, as well as procedural generation.

Project Name: Relic

Short Description:
    A dungeon crawler with procedurally generated levels, monsters of increasing difficulty,
    and turn-based movement.

Story:
    For generations, the city of Mharnem has paid faithful tribute to the gods. Countless festivals,
    sacrifices, and the like have been held in the name of the Qentyoi - the gods of Earth. Despite all this,
    the city now finds itself in a perilous position when pestilence strikes the people, debilitating or killing many.
    Those that manage to avoid infection find themselves set upon by horrendous creatures. Hushed whispers among the city's 
    clergy speak of a forgotten tome of immense power, said to contain knowledge transcribed by Anthrophulos himself and
    hidden in the ancient catacombs beneath the city.
    You don't know if the book exists, but your townsfolk are dying and their prayers are unanswered. You decide to venture into
    the catacombs yourself and return with the answer to Mharnem's plight or die an honorable death...

Basic Game Loops:
    Enter catacomb level
    Explore, revealing the map
    Encounter enemies to fight/flee
    Find power-ups and use them to strengthen the player
    Locate the exit to the level, repeat

Minimum Viable Product:
    Create a basic catacomb map
    Place the player and let them move around
    Spawn monsters, draw them, and let the player kill them by walking into them
    Add health and a combat system that uses it
    Add healing potions
    Display a "Game Over" screen when the player dies
    Add the Book of Anthrophulos to the level and let the player win by touching it 

Stretch Goals:
    Add fields-of-view
    Add more intricate dungeon designs
    Add dungeon themes 
    Add multiple layers to the catacombs, with the Book in the last one
    Add varied weapons to the game 
    Move to a data-driven design for spawning enemies 
    Consider some visual effects to make combat more visceral
    Consider keeping score/time limit

Ideas for personal expansion:
    Change overall theme from fantasy to sci-fi/horror
    Increase variety of enemies
    Introduce locked doors and corresponding keys
    Introduce more items:
        NV goggles: increase player FOV and apply green tint to environment
        Speed enhancement
        Attack armor
    Introduce environmental hazards
        poison gas - could require gas mask item to traverse
    Add a scoring mechanism
    Introduce save/load functionality
    Look into a shift into real-time gameplay instead of turn-based
    If possible, look into Bevy game engine for possible improvements
    Flesh out story of the game with intro screen and outro screen
